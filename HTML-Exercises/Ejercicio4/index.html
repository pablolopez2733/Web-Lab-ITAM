                            The Colts have been a member club of the NFL since their founding in Baltimore in 1953. 
                            They were one of three NFL teams to join those of the American Football League (AFL) to form the 
                            AFC following the 1970 merger. While in Baltimore, the team advanced to the playoffs 10 times and 
                            won three NFL Championship games in 1958, 1959, and 1968. The Colts played in two Super Bowls while 
                            they were based in Baltimore, losing to the New York Jets in Super Bowl III and defeating the Dallas
                            Cowboys in Super Bowl V. The Colts relocated to Indianapolis in 1984 and have since appeared in the 
                            playoffs 16 times, won two conference championships, and won one Super Bowl, in which they defeated
                            the Chicago Bears in Super Bowl XLI.
                            Following disappointing seasons and poor fan attendance, the franchise moved to Indianapolis in 1984. 
                            While in Baltimore the team achieved ten postseason appearances and won four championships.The Colts organization 
                            struggled in the early days in Indianapolis, compiling an 88â€“135 record from 1984 to 1997. During that time the Colts 
                            were led by seven different head coaches and seventeen different starting quarterbacks. The organization made three 
                            postseason appearances during the time, with the most success coming in 1995 and 1996 under quarterback Jim Harbaugh. 
                            The 1995 team made it to the AFC Championship Game, which they lost to the Pittsburgh Steelers.
