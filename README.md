# Web-Lab-ITAM
This are a couple of exercises that I did while I participated in the web design lab while in college.
A quick description of each exercise:
*GIF-Generator: Connects to Giphy via the giphy API and randomly generates a gif everytime you click a button.
* Pyramid-JS: Generates a centered asterix pyramid when a button is clicked.
* Language-Signup: This projects pulls a dummy database of a language school system. The user can add courses and then checkout and pay.
* HTML-Exercises:
1. Chess Board: Generates a Chess Board across a blank page.
2. Color Squares: Half the screen turns blue and the other half turns orange.
3. Colts Page: A dummy page for my favorite NFL team: the Indianapolis Colts.
4. Concentric Squares: Some concentric squares generated using vanilla CSS.
